# AAsm

The goal of this project is to write a working x86-64 assembler in pure C11 producing elf object files and/or executables. To prove that the program is functional I will also re-write it in itself once it's usable.

The name is subject to change obviously.

I'm using tsoding's [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h) to build the project.

Yes I'm feeling completly fine why do you ask.
